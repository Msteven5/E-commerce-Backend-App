## Description

This CLI application was created to give an example of the way a backend catalog interacts with the user input through endpoints and Express.

## Installation

For this application to work as intended, you will need to clone the repository from GitHub, as well as download the Express, mySQL2, Sequelize, and dotenv node packages and establish a connection to mySQL to allow data to have permanence.

## Usage

This application can be used as a simple ecommerce backend catalog.

## Contributing

I, Michael Davidson am the only one that contributed to this code using mySQL, JavaScript, Node, and the Node packages listed above.

## Tests
